## Verification Notes
Crystal skulls are proven modern forgeries with no authentic pre-Columbian examples:

**Scientific Evidence:**
- Electron microscopy shows modern rotary tool marks on all examined skulls
- No crystal skull has been found in controlled archaeological excavation
- Manufacturing techniques consistent with 19th century European lapidary work
- Material analysis shows modern cutting and polishing

**Historical Evidence:**
- First appearance in 1860s-1880s European collections
- Traced to dealers like Eugene Boban
- False discovery stories (e.g., Mitchell-Hedges auction documentation)
- Complete absence from Spanish colonial period records

**Archaeological Consensus:**
- No professional archaeologist accepts crystal skulls as pre-Columbian
- Authentic Mesoamerican skull carvings are small, crude, stylistically distinct
- Scientific literature universally classifies as forgeries
- Museums with skulls acknowledge them as modern fakes

The crystal skulls represent a clear case of archaeological fraud, perpetuated by commercial interests and sustained by pseudoarchaeological claims despite overwhelming scientific evidence of their true 19th century European origin.

---

**Research Guidelines**: Treat crystal skulls as definitively debunked hoaxes. Scientific evidence is conclusive and archaeological consensus is absolute. While documenting the phenomenon's cultural impact and why beliefs persist is valuable, there should be no ambiguity about the skulls' modern European origin. Use as an excellent teaching example about importance of provenance, scientific analysis, and critical thinking in archaeology.
